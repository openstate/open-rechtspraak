  <h3>Offset pagination</h3>

  <p>You might have noticed that the response from the quickstart only returned a list of 20 people. The API only
    returns a limited number of people per request, which ensures you'll get a quick response. This is called a
    page.</p>

  <p>Offset pagination allows you to retrieve a subsequent list of records, in other words: it allows you to retrieve
    the
    next page. Offset pagination works with two query parameters: <code>offset</code> and <code>limit</code>.</p>

  <p><code>offset</code> determines the number of records that should be skipped. <code>limit</code> determines the number
    of records per page. The maximum limit for our API is 100. If our API includes 1.000 people, that means you'll need
    to perform at least 10 requests.</p>

  <p>Here is an example that retrieves the first 5 pages of people from our API:</p>

  <pre><code class="language-python">limit = 5
people = []

for page in range(0, 5):
    r = requests.get("http://localhost:5000/api/v1/person", params={
        'offset': limit * page,
        'limit': limit
    })
    response = r.json()
    people.extend(response.get("data"))

    print(f"Retrieved records for page {page}")

print(f"Done! Retrieved {len(people)} people")
</code></pre>
</div>
